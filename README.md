# Hand Gesture Recognition (Perceptron and CNN)

Goal is to recognize hand gestures. I've trained the model on my own dataset using *Perceptron* (and *CNN* thereafter). I've included my dataset in the repository itself. In it's present state the model is trained to recognize just two (now four) gestures (please see the *CNN* implementation section in this readme, I trained it for 4 gestures afterwards) but can easily be trained for many hand gestures.
I'll also upload the code that I'm using for capturing the hand an processing it for training the model.

Model gives a high testing accuracy of about **99%** using just two *Dense* layers. But if you want to train more hand gestures then you'll probably need more a complex network.
